# 4hp Line Input / VCA 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fihdi/Eurorack/refs/heads/main/LIN/LIN-Front.png)

LIN is a 4hp Line Input module allowing you to take a line level signal from eg. a laptop, mp3 player, mobile phone etc. and boost it to Eurorack level. The volume is controlled by a VCA, which allows you to control the volume, or chop up the incoming audio signal. You can also distort existing eurorack signal by boosting the signal until it clips.

The module that you see in the picture above is the finished product using circuit boards that were fabricated by PCBWay. It is my smallest (slimmest) module so far and as always, they have excellent build quality! I used the "Black" option for the soldermask and the surface has very deep and glossy black finish, which looks amazing.

[Visit PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) The website is intuitive and easy to use, just upload the gerber and drill files as a .zip-file, tick the options such as base material, board width, my favorite feature: separate colors for the soldermask and silkscreen, surface finish etc. With multiple options for payment and fast delivery fast times I was able to put the entire project together in less than one month.
