Sample and Hold/ Track and Hold module and white Noise

Missing Base resistor for Q4

Opamp needs a high gain because the noise is really small in amplitude.

Hack: Replace the capacitor with a 100K or 10k Pull down Resistor and switch the module to Track and Hold mode. This turns the Sample and hold section into a signal Switch that works with pos. and neg. voltages.
