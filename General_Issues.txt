ToDo: Adding finished Gerber files. Add the text "OpenSource Module by Fihdi" to every module somewhere.

-Module widths are not up to norm, meaning, when putting modules side by side the mounting holes may not exactly line up on a rails with 5.08mm spacing.

-Custom power connector instead of the standard 10-pin IDC connector

-No grounding on the jacks sleeves.

-Need to create BOMs and sources for components

-No values and misaligned designators on the PCBs.

-Missing bypass capacitors on almost every IC

-Potentiometer Orientation

-Potentiometer ranges

-No "JLC" Label, when ordering through JLCPCB, the ordering number is printed on a random location and so it might be visible and ugly.
