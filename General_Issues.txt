-Custom power connector instead of the standard 10-pin IDC connector

-No grounding on the jacks sleeves.

-Missing bypass capacitors on almost every IC

-Potentiometer Orientation

-Potentiometer ranges

-No values on the schematics

-No "JLC" Label, when ordering through JLCPCB, the ordering number is printed on a random location and so it might be visible and ugly.
