UNTESTED! An improved Sampler module based on the Daisy Seed by Electrosmith.

The sample can be selected via a rotary encoder and the playback speed can be changed via a knob or an external CV. A Gate signal to the RANDOM input will select a random sample.

Depending on the PART/ENTIRE switch, the sample will either play in its entirity or only play while the gate signal is active.
