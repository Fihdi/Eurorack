# 18hp Dual VCO module

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fihdi/Eurorack/refs/heads/main/DualOsc/DualOsc-Front.png)

Two triangle core VCOs with volt per octave tracking, FM, Synchronization and PWM. Both VCOs are identical and can be used independantely. The middle section allows for modulation from the left VCO to the right VCO and can switched on or off via switches. The strength of this modulation is controlable via the AMT knob and a control voltage and is indicated by the arrow LED. Four trimmers at the back of the mainboard are used to tune the volt per octave response and the sine shaper.

This module was meant to replace my old VCO and I have decided to build this project using SMD components to save space and to test the in-house PCB assembly by [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/). It was great to receive a fully assembled board without having to solder it for hours, which can be very tedious when using SMD components. The soldering was perfect out of the box and it allowed me to solder in the last THT components and to tune the module. The front panel is also made of FR4 with white silkscreen and a glossy black finish. I received great help from their support regarding the formatting of the BOM, which they used to source the materials and to assemble my PCB.
