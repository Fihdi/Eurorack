MISSING POWER and POWER ROUTED WRONG

Inverse VCO:
-No input hysteresis

Slew Rate Limiter:
-I don't know why but it does not slew when I built it, or at the very least it does not slew very noticably. Maybe just a bigger cap is needed.

Attenuverter:
-No issues but some LEDs would be nice, same for the analog XOR
