This is the same module with the same front but it is using an DG411 Analog Switch IC by Vishay, this one can switch the analog signals as they are, no need for voltage to current conversion black magic.

The issue with the comparators have been fixed as well. I have not built this module in real life so I cannot confirm its functionality or performance.
