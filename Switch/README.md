Two Voltage Controlled Switches with analog logic outputs based on https://www.schmitzbits.de/switch.html

Issue: The comparators for A>B and B>A should compare the inputs before the switches, not after. This has been fixed in the "Switch2" project, I seriously recommend building that instead, it is using the DG412 IC and the same front.
