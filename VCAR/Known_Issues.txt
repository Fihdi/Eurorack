Voltage controlled Slew and Attack/Release Envelope Generator

NEW IMPROVED VERSION IN THE "VCAR" SUB FOLDER! 

Removing D4 so that a positive voltage is not trapped between D4 and C1, BUT! Loop mode still only works by connecting EOC to IN and I don't know why.

COMP1 and COMP2 should be done with summing amplifiers for the full range.

Diode on the input for positive voltages only BUT that results in many Voltage drops accross the input, the Attack VCR, the base-emitter path of Q3. -> Shottky Diodes

Positive voltages only! Replace the CD4066 for a DG411 or similar for negative voltages as well.

Connecting the front and B-Board in a rigth angle results in the power connector almost touching an input.
