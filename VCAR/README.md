# 10hp Voltage controlled Attack and Release/Slew rate limiter

Voltage controlled SLEW Rate limiter / Attack/Release Module.

Can be used as an Envelope Generator, Slew Rate Limiter, VCO, LFO, Waveshaper, Gate Delay, Rythm Generator and a million other things.

Finally got this one working after 3 Revisions....

Schematic inspired by the legendary Dual Universal Slope Generator by Serge Tcherepnin, and later on Make Noise Maths, Befaco Rampage, Kassutronics Slope, etc.

One thing that could be added would be a jumper at the summing stage for the Rise (Attack) CV so that the feedback signal goes to either the first or second inverting stage ( the second inverter would then also be an inverting summing amplifier). This would give sharkfins instead of exponential spikes.
