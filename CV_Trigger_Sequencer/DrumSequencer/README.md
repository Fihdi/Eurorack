No Rotary-Switch for the amount of steps.

Pulse / Trigger Outputs A, B and C have been made for the Sampler Module, but they can be used to trigger anything (Envelopes, Sample and Hold, etc)

Ideas:
One modifaction I will definitely try is to route one of the inputs (IN1 to 3) to an analog input pin of the ATMega328P. This way the stage which is active is CV-controllable. You can also programm an onboard LFO where the rate of this LFO can be CV-controlled.

Tap-tempo with an input or the push-button.
