MIDI Interface module with 5-Pin MIDI input and with 4 CV and 4 Gate/Trigger outputs. It lets you control other modules with MIDI Controllers or DAWs.

Known Issue: I used the wrong Pins for the PWM outputs, 5 traces, A1 to A4 and "SW", need to be re-routed. I made the project "MIDI-BackBoard2" where I corrected this issue. If you build it, buy the front and the backboard seperately.

Module is inspired by CircuitsAndSounds AutomationSequencer Project and is similar to an Univer Inter from Noise Engineering
