The core oscillator of this circuit is the same as in the TRIVCO module, an OTA-based relaxation oscillator, so this module can be used as a VCO as well.

No more Shape control, only way to get a sawtooth signal is to connect its square-wave output into the RESET input. 

10/10/2024: I built this module for real but it does not work as well as I had hoped, will have to do some debugging later. Build the original LFO for now.

01.06.2025: Debugged this circuit and tested it with the rest of the synth, works fine now.
