NOT WORKING WELL! VC-LFO Module with voltage control over the frequency. The LFO can be reset and stopped at any time using gates.

The core oscillator of this circuit is the same as in the TRIVCO module, an OTA-based relaxation oscillator, so this module can be used as a VCO as well.

No more Shape control, only way to get a sawtooth signal is to connect its square-wave output into the RESET input. 

10/10/2024: I built this module for real but it does not work as well as I had hoped, will have to do some debugging later. Build the original LFO for now.
