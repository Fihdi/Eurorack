Snare / Hi Hat module with CV control over the envelope accent, decay Time. The Decay Time can be controlled externally or with an internal random voltage generator.

Issue: The 100nF cap at the envelope generator (in series with the diode) should be the same size as the capacitor after the diode (470nF). This issue could be bypassed completely by using the same envelope generator as in my Drum module, but that wouldnt make that much of a difference.

The Sample and hold at RVG doesnt seem to work.
