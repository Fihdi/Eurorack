# 8hp Hi-Hat module

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fihdi/Eurorack/main/Hat/Hat_Front.png)

Snare / Hi Hat module with CV control over the decay Time.

Known Issue: The top part of this module should be a random voltage generator whose signal can be used to control the decay time, this does not work as of right now.
