Snare / Hi Hat module with CV control over the envelope accent, decay Time. The Decay Time can be controlled externally or with an internal random voltage generator.

Issue: The 100nF cap at the envelope generator (in series with the diode) should be the same size as the capacitor after the diode (470nF).

The Sample and hold at RVG doesnt seem to work.

Feedback resistor at the Noise section should be 1k and not 100k for a gain of ~100
