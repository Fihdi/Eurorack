Voltage controlled Filter.

A two-pole multimode Filter with Lowpass, Bandpass and Highpass outputs.

Ideas and Improvements:

5 minutes after ordering the VCF I, of course, got a great idea for a feature that I could have included: A Notch output.
By subtracting the bandpass output from the original signal you get an output with Notch-filter characteristics IN THEORY. I do not think it would work very well with just a simple subtractor circuit because of the phase shift between the bandpass and the original signal.

Using a VCA for CV-Resonance (Not necessary for me to be honest)
