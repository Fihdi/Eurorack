# 10hp Quantizer / ARP / Programmable Scale
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fihdi/Eurorack/refs/heads/main/QuantARP/QuantARP-Front.png)

A quantizer with CV and Trigger inputs and CV and Audio Outputs. Turns an analog CV input into selected notes according to the V/Oct standard. By pressing the buttons you can add or remove notes from the scale. A rising edge to the TRG input plays the next allowed note within the octave.

ToDo: improve the hysteresis. Add multiple ARP Modes (DOWN, UP and DOWN) and over multiple octaves.
