PCBWay sponsored the production of this module using their standard PCB process. The entire production was very quick, around 3 days to complete. The front plate that I used is also a PCB with a glossy black finish. As always, I can recommend PCBWay for quick and affordable prototyping for your own projects. The website is intuitive and easy to use, just upload your gerber and drill files as a .zip file and you get your quote instantly.

If you include a BOM you can use their assembly feature to get a pre-populated board, saving time and improving efficiency.
