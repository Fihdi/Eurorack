No idea if the current project works because I have not built this module in real life, only on computer.

This is a voltage controlled two-pole filter with low-, band- and highpass modes. OTA design based on Skull and Circuits VCF-3. 

The VCF on the picture is the same schematic, but the PCB was made with EAGLE, which I no longer use.
