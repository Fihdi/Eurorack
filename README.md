# Open Source Eurorack Synthesizer

Schematics and PCBs for my Eurorack modules

If you were to build these modules yourself make sure to separate the boards in the KiCad projects! Besides revision boards, I combine every PCB of a module into a single board (because its cheaper) and use a PCB cutter like this to separate them. Separate the boards in the KiCad project or add V-cuts.

Most modules have some minor bugs, they are summarised in the "README.md" of each module. Please inspect the Kicad projects before ordering and do not blindly trust the resistor values in the schematics. Its best if you breadboard the schematics and see if it behaves and sounds the way you want.

Open points and Issues that can be applied to the whole project are summarized in "General_Issues.txt"
