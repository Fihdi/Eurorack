# Open Source Eurorack Synthesizer

Schematics and PCBs for my Eurorack modules

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fihdi/Eurorack/main/PersonalSetup.png)

Most modules have some minor bugs, they are summarised in the "README.md" of each module. Please inspect the Kicad projects before ordering and do not blindly trust the resistor values in the schematics. Its best if you breadboard the schematics and see if it behaves and sounds the way you want.

Open points and Issues that can be applied to the whole project are summarized in "General_Issues.txt"
