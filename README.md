# Open Source Eurorack Synthesizer

Schematics and PCBs for my Eurorack modules

Update from 10.05.2025: The picture below shows my current setup, as you can see, many modules have solder joints on the front because I started out by making the frontplates out of PCB with the circuitry on them. All* of my proper modules have now been fixed in Kicad to be free of solder joints on the front but the image below will remain the same for a LONG time (I'm NOT soldering 15+ modules again to fix a minor issue lol)
