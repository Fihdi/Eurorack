A simple Microphone pre-amplifier with adjustable Gain. Audio and GATE outputs.

The entire circuitry is visible on the front.

When the microphone is being talked into, the GATE output goes high. This can be used for the Sampler module for recording for example, or you can turn on effects/VCAs/switches etc. with your voice.
