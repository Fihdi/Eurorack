Crossfader that can fade between two audio or CV signals. Two VCA cores that can be used together (Locked mode) or seperately (Free mode).

The "FADE" output always sums both Outputs together, regardless of the mode.

I plan on making a third board, kind of like a shield, that can be inserted into the AS3360 IC socket. This shield should replace the 3360 with an equivalent VCA circuit with regular parts like the TL074. This is because the AS3360 IC is rather scarce and expensive since it is only produced by one company, Alfa Semiconductors based in Latvia.
