3 Channel Sampler that pairs well with the A, B and C outputs of my sequencer

The solder points for the buttons are too close to the hole.
When the push button is stuck through the PCB and tightend with a washer, the washer will make contact with both solder points and the button is effectively always pressed.

The summing amplifier should have a gain of two since the ISD1820 are running on 5V and are rather quiet compared to normal eurorack levels.
